> *When you're too tired to study but too Italian to stop yapping*

## 📖 The Story

I wanted to study for an exam, but I was too tired. Us Italians love talking loudly, you can't remove the yapping from us, actually, whether you want it or not, this yapping is going through your ears and mind.

So I did whatever any reasonable person would do: I built a knowledge graph out of this and made a chat app so that people can experience a glimpse of what I have gone through, because let's be real, I am not going to remember it.
